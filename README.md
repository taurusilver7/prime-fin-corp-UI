> A fully responsive website with modern UI/UX design with React & TailwindCSS.

This project was scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project), a build tool for providing faster & leaner development experience.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
#and
Enter the project name, framework & programming language to work with.
# and
cd <project_name>
# and
yarn install (or) npm install (to add default dependencies)
# and
yarn dev (to start the development server)
```

## dependencies

Import tailwind & its surrounding dependencies into the project.

```bash
yarn add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer -D
# and
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Config

The `vite.config.js` confirms the programming language & the key library for building the application through its plugin.

The `tailwind.config.cjs` holds the predefined styles & configuration snippets for tailwindcss.
